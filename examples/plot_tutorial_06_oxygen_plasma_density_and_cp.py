Tutorial 06: Calculating the density and heat capacity of an :math:`O_2` plasma.
================================================================================

The most common use of minplascalc is the calculation of thermophysical
properties of plasmas in LTE. In this example we'll look at the thermodynamic
properties :math:`\rho` and :math:`c_p`.


The relatively simple case of a pure oxygen plasma is useful for demonstration
and validation purposes. As in
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_tutorial_05_oygen_plasma_lte_composition.py`,
a Mixture object must be created by the user to specify the plasma species
present and the relative proportions of elements.
We'll use a system identical to the previous example.

# %%
# Import the required libraries.
# ------------------------------
#
# We start by importing the modules we need:
#
# - matplotlib for drawing graphs,
# - numpy for array functions,
# - and of course minplascalc.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import minplascalc as mpc

# %%
# Create mixture object for the species we're interested in.
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Next, we create a minplascalc LTE mixture object. Here we use a helper
# function in minplascalc which creates the object directly from a list of the
# species names.

oxygen_mixture = mpc.mixture.lte_from_names(
    ["O2", "O2+", "O", "O-", "O+", "O++"], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 1000, 101325
)
# %%
# Set a range of temperatures to calculate the equilibrium compositions at.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Next, set a range of temperatures to calculate the equilibrium compositions
# at - in this case we're going from 1000 to 25000 K in 100 K steps.
# Also initialise a list to store the property values at each temperature.

temperatures = np.linspace(1000, 25000, 100)
density = []
cp = []
h = []

# %%
# Perform the composition calculations.
# --------------------------------------
#
# Now we can perform the property calculations.
# We loop over all the temperatures setting the mixture object's temperature
# attribute to the appropriate value, and calculating the plasma density by
# calling the LTE object's `calculate_density()` and
# `calculate_heat_capacity()` functions. Internally, these make calls to
# `calculate_composition()` to obtain the composition of the plasma before the
# calculation of the properties.
#
# Note that execution of this calculation is fairly compute intensive and the
# following code snippet may take several seconds to complete.

for T in temperatures:
    oxygen_mixture.T = T
    density.append(oxygen_mixture.calculate_density())
    cp.append(oxygen_mixture.calculate_heat_capacity())
    h.append(oxygen_mixture.calculate_enthalpy())


# %%
# Plot the results.
# -----------------
#
# Now we can visualise the properties by plotting them against temperature, to
# see how they vary.

# %%
# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# The results obtained using minplascalc are comparable to other data for
# oxygen plasmas in literature, for example [Boulos2023]_. In particular the
# position and size of the peaks in :math:`C_p`, which are caused by the highly
# nonlinear dissociation and first ionisation reactions of :math:`O_2` and
# :math:`O` respectively, are accurately captured.
