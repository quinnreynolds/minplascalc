Tutorial 01: Adding a new monatomic species entry to your local data store, the manual way.
===========================================================================================

If you would like to do calculations using a plasma species that you haven't used before,
you will need to generate a minplascalc data entry for it first.
You only need to do this once< - minplascalc can store the species data in a plain-text file
formatted using JSON syntax, and it will then be available for use in any of your future calculations.
"""  # noqa: D205

# %%
# Data needed to create a species can be obtained from the energy levels and lines section of
# the NIST Atomic Spectra Database, which can be found at http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD.
# For example, the landing page for levels looks like this:
#
# .. image:: ../../data/demo/img/asd_landingpage.png
#   :width: 800
#   :alt: NIST ASD landing page

# %%
# You must then specify the atom or ion that you want to retrieve energy level information for.
# Let's get the data for the singly-charged oxygen cation species :math:`O^+`, which is "O II"
# in spectrographic terminology. Enter the identifier in the Spectrum field on the form:
#
# .. image:: ../../data/demo/img/asd_spectrumidentification.png
#   :width: 400
#   :alt: Spectrum identification

# %%
# Set your preferences according to how you prefer to access the data.
# Make sure the "Level" and "J" checkboxes are ticked, since these are the data we will need
# for minplascalc.
#
# .. image:: ../../data/demo/img/asd_retrievalsettings.png
#   :width: 400
#   :alt: Spectrum identification


# %%
# Click the Retrieve Data button. You should receive a page with the energy levels listed out.
# You'll need to transfer this data into some format that you can manipulate in Python,
# either by saving text manually or using web scraping tools.
#
# .. image:: ../../data/demo/img/asd_leveldata1.png
#   :width: 400
#   :alt: Spectrum identification
# .. image:: ../../data/demo/img/asd_leveldata2.png
#   :width: 400
#   :alt: Spectrum identification
# .. image:: ../../data/demo/img/asd_leveldata3.png
#   :width: 400
#   :alt: Spectrum identification

# %%
# Convert the data to a list of length-2 lists, one for each eletronic energy level.
# Each list entry must contain the degeneracy of the level :math:`j` and the level's energy in J.
# A similar exercise must then be performed for the spectral lines using the "lines" form on
# the NIST ASD - these must be stored in a list of length-3 lists containing the line wavelength
# :math:`\lambda` in m, the transition strength :math:`g_k A_{ki}` in 1/s,
# and the line energy :math:`E_k` in J.
# This exercise has already been performed for the oxygen cation, and data lists from NIST ASD
# are stored in pickle files at data/demo/nist.
#
# Additional pieces of data needed to create a species object are:
#
# * The elemental stoichiometry of the species.
# * The molar mass of the species, in kg/mol.
# * The electric charge in units of the elementary charge.
# * The ionisation energy of the species, in J.
# * The polarisability of the species, in :math:`m^3`.
# * The multiplicity of the ground state.
# * The number of effective valence electrons (see docstring for more information),
#   only used by neutral species.
# * Information about electron collision cross sections (see docstring for more information),
#   only used by neutral species.
# * A list of sources describing the provenance of the data.

# %%
# Running the following code snippet will create a minplascalc Species object for the :math:`O^+` ion,
# and then store it to a file for later reuse:

import pickle

import minplascalc as mpc

with open("../data/demo/nist/nist_Oplus_levels", "rb") as f:
    elevels = pickle.load(f)
with open("../data/demo/nist/nist_Oplus_emissionlines", "rb") as f:
    elines = pickle.load(f)

oxygenplus = mpc.species.Monatomic(
    name="O+",
    stoichiometry={"O": 1},
    molar_mass=0.01599885642,
    charge_number=1,
    ionisation_energy=5.6270249236e-18,
    energy_levels=elevels,
    polarisability=0.391e-30,
    multiplicity=4,
    effective_electrons=None,
    electron_cross_section=None,
    emission_lines=elines,
    sources=[
        "NIST Atomic Spectra Database (ver. 5.3), [Online]. A Kramida, "
        "Yu Ralchenko, J Reader, and NIST ASD Team, National Institute "
        "of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg MD., "
        "http://physics.nist.gov/asd"
    ],
)

print(oxygenplus)

oxygenplus.to_file()


# %%
# What's happening here?
# First we import the minplascalc package, then unpack the NIST data files for energy levels and
# emission lines, then we create a `Monatomic` species object, and finally we save the contents to a data file
#
# The `Monatomic` class constructor takes as arguments the lists of energy levels and lines, as well as
# the pieces of data described above. Once created, the object can be written out to disk using the Species
# object's `to_file` utility function, which saves data to a human-readable JSON-formatted file.
# It takes an optional file path argument - if omitted, the filename is created using the species' name
# and written to the current working directory.
#
# After this process it will be possible to create an :math:`O^+` species object in any minplascalc
# calculation by importing it using either the explicit path to the JSON file, or (preferably) just the
# name of the species provided the JSON file is stored in any of the standard minplascalc data paths -
# see later tutorials for examples.
# Note that for this to work correctly in all cases, minplascalc's JSON files must be stored on a
# case-sensitive operating system or partition.
