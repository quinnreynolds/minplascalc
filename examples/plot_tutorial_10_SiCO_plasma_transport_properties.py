Tutorial 10: Calculating transport and radiation properties of an SiO-CO plasma.
================================================================================

The most common use of minplascalc is expected to be the calculation of thermophysical properties
of plasmas in LTE as a function of elemental composition, temperature, and pressure.
For the more complex SiO-CO plasma, mixtures must be created as described in
:ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_tutorial_08_SiCO_plasma_LTE_composition.py`
to specify the plasma species present and the relative proportions of elements.

For this tutorial we'll again look at three different SiO-CO mixtures ranging from 10% SiO to 90% SiO
by mole to show how the properties are affected by different mixture ratios.

# Import the required libraries.
# ------------------------------
#
# We start by importing the modules we need:
#
# - matplotlib for drawing graphs,
# - numpy for array functions,
# - and of course minplascalc.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import minplascalc as mpc

# %%
# Create mixture object for the species we're interested in.
# ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Next, we create some minplascalc LTE mixture objects as before.

# Set a range of temperatures to calculate the equilibrium compositions at.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Next, set a range of temperatures to calculate the equilibrium compositions at - in this case
# we're going from 1000 to 25000 K in 100 K steps.
# Also initialise a list to store the property values at each temperature.

total_emission_coefficient: list[list[float]] = [[], [], []]

# %%
# Perform the composition calculations.
# --------------------------------------
#
# Now we can perform the property calculations.
# We loop over all the temperatures setting the mixture object's temperature attribute
# to the appropriate value, and calculating the plasma density by calling the LTE
# object's `calculate_viscosity()`, `calculate_electrical_conductivity()`,
# `calculate_thermal_conductivity()` and `calculate_total_emission_coefficient()` functions.
# Internally, these make calls to  `calculate_composition()` to obtain the composition
# of the plasma before the calculation of the properties.
#
# Note that execution of this calculation is fairly compute intensive and the following code
# snippet may take several tens of selectrical_conductivitys to complete.

    print(f"Calculating properties for {sico_mixture}", end="\n")
    for T in temperatures:

        )
        thermal_conductivity[i].append(sico_mixture.calculate_thermal_conductivity())

# %%
# Plot the results.
# -----------------
#
# Now we can visualise the properties by plotting them against temperature, to see how they vary.

# Conclusion
# ----------
#
# The impact of changing the elemental composition of the plasma is again quite considerable
# and non-linear, especially for thermal conductivity and emission coefficient.
# The general trend as SiO content in the plasma increases is toward slightly lower values of
# :math:`\mu` and :math:`\kappa`, and much higher values of :math:`\epsilon_{tot}`, with
# :math:`\sigma` varying relatively little except at high temperatures.
