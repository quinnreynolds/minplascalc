    "## Module Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Ionised gases or <i>plasmas</i> are used in many industrial applications such as arc welding, plasma spraying, and electric furnace metallurgy. Engineering plasmas typically operate at atmospheric pressures and temperatures of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> K. Thermal plasmas of the sort considered here are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibirum (LTE), meaning that a single unique temperature can be used to describe them. A major advantage of the LTE approximation is that all thermophysical properties of an equilibrium mixture of an arbitrary number of plasma species can be expressed as (complicated) functions of temperature and pressure only - composition is implicit since it is uniquely determined by the state parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge of these thermophysical properties is of great value to engineers working in plasma technology. Such information is useful for simple design calculations, and is necessary input data for computational fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics models of plasma systems. The calculation of composition and thence the thermophysical properties of a thermal plasma given some fundamental information about the species present is a well-understood but mathematically and numerically complex process. It is prone to error if performed manually, hence the need for this tool.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall that the partition function for a particular species is a description of the statistical properties of a collection of atoms or molecules of that species at thermodynamic equilibrium. Partition functions are normally presented as the sum of weighted state probabilities across the possible energy states of the system. In general at moderate plasma temperatures up to a few 10<sup>4</sup> K, a species' total partition function $Q_{tot}$ can be written as the product of several unique partition functions arising from different quantum mechanical phenomena (assuming weak state coupling and no contribution from nuclear states):\n",

    "Given temperature, pressure, and a set of species present in a plasma (and some information about the elemental composition of the mixture if more than one element is present), the number density of each species at thermodynamic equilibrium can be calculated using the principle of Gibbs free energy minimisation. This is an important intermediate step in calculating the thermopysical properties, and may also be useful in its own right if one is interested in the relative proportions of different species in complex plasmas. It is exposed to the user in the minplascalc API.\n",

    "#### Ionisation energy lowering\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the ionisation energy required to remove a single electron from a particle of a species is a constant for that particular species when considered in isolation. However, in a mixture of different species and free electrons, the ionisation energy is lowered by a small amount due to local electrostatic shielding effects. This affects both the calculation of the partition functions (the summation of electronic state contributions for monatomic species ignores states with energies above the lowered ionisation energy) and the calculation of equilibrium plasma compositions (the equilibrium relationships are defined using the reference energy levels for each species, which in turn depend on the lowered ionisation energies). Ionisation energy lowering is a complex problem in plasma physics, but there exist many approximate methods for quantifying this effect using the theory of Debye-shielded potentials. Provided the same method is used for all species, the calculation errors generally remain small. The ionisation energy lowering calculation is not exposed to the user in the minplascalc API, since it is only required internally for calculation of species partition functions and LTE compositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "minplascalc uses the analytical solution of Stewart and Pyatt 1966 (see references in README). In this method, the ionisation energy lowering for each positively-charged species is calculated explicitly using:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\delta E_i}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\left [ \\left (\\frac{a_i}{l_D} \\right )^3 + 1 \\right ]^\\frac{2}{3} -1}{2 \\left( z^*+1 \\right)}$$\n",
